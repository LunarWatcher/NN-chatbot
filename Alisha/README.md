# Alisha

Alisha is a cross-site chatbot written in Java and Kotlin. The flexible framework allows for virtually any site to be added to the bot.

There's existing support for chat.stackoverflow.com, chat.meta.stackexchange.com, chat.stackexchange.com and Discord. 

The bot is a WIP, so more features will be added. Most notably, more commands are due very soon. Planned commands include:

* ~~About~~
* ~~learn/unlearn~~
* ~~A better help command~~
* ~~Help with specific commands~~
* animal 
    * Show a random animal picture
* ~~ban/unban~~
* ~~admin/unadmin~~
    * expanded bot privileges, but not as much as the bot owner/s (hard-coded into the properties file)
* status
    * message count from users
    * ~~A custom part on Discord~~
* ~~Random number~~
* stackexchange question search
* ~~LMGTFY~~
* silence
    * Ignores specific users for a short period of time, **not to be confused with ban**.
    * Ignore all users for a short period of time
* ~~join/leave (SE only)~~

In addition to commands, there are other features that need implementation:

* Listeners (non-command detection)
* Ping-to-chat
